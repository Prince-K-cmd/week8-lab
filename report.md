## Introduction

### Project Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project represents a significant undertaking in applying machine learning techniques to historical data. This project combines data science methodologies with software engineering best practices to create a robust and maintainable solution.

### Problem Statement

The challenge involves predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using various demographic and ticket information. This binary classification problem serves as both a practical machine learning exercise and a meaningful analysis of historical data.

### Dataset Overview

## Data Exploration and Analysis

### Initial Data Assessment

Initial exploration revealed several key aspects of the dataset:

- Total records: 891 (training) + 418 (test)
- 12 initial features
- Mix of numerical and categorical data
- Presence of missing values in key fields

### Missing Value Analysis

- **Age**: ~20% missing
  - Critical for survival prediction
  - Required sophisticated imputation
- **Cabin**: ~77% missing
  - High missing rate
  - Created derived features from available data
- **Embarked**: <1% missing
  - Minimal impact
  - Simple imputation sufficient

### Survival Pattern Analysis

Key patterns discovered in the data:

1. **Gender Impact**

   - Women had significantly higher survival rates (74%)
   - Men had lower survival rates (19%)

2. **Class Influence**

   - First-class: 63% survival rate
   - Second-class: 47% survival rate
   - Third-class: 24% survival rate

3. **Age Patterns**
   - Children (0-10): 60% survival rate
   - Adults (25-40): 35% survival rate
   - Elderly (60+): 25% survival rate

## Methodology

### Model Selection

We implemented and compared three primary models:

1. **Logistic Regression**

   - Baseline model
   - L1/L2 regularization
   - Feature selection capabilities

2. **Random Forest**

   - Feature importance
   - Robust to overfitting

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
   - High-dimensional spaces
   - Kernel tricks
   - Margin optimization

## Implementation
